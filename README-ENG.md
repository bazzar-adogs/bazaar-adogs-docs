# 🐾 Donation Bazaar Supply Tracker for Dog Shelter (In Progress)

## 🙋 Why are we making this?

Through a friend, we learned about a local donation bazaar held to support stray dogs.  
While organizing the event, volunteers shared that they were having a hard time keeping track of all the donated items.  
Supplies were coming in from various places, and it was difficult to know **who had what, how much was available, and what was still missing**.

So, our team decided to build a simple web app that would help volunteers easily **register, manage, and view supply information**.  
Our goal is not to make something complex, but something that **actually works and helps—before and during the event**.

## 📦 What does this app do?

- ✅ **Add / edit / remove items**: Anyone can register supplies they’re storing or donating  
- ✅ **View current supplies**: See everything in one place  
- ✅ **Categorize items**: By type—food, toys, clothes, etc.  
- ✅ **Status labels**: Such as “Delivered”, “In Transit”, “Still Needed”

> 🙌 *It’s not fancy—but it’s built for real use on the ground.*

We’re building something meaningful, not perfect.  
If it can make the lives of volunteers just a little easier—we think it’s worth it.  
All feedback is welcome. Thank you!
